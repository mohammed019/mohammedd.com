Hello guys

I have error when i try to import:
   const { pending } = useFormStatus();


First of all the useFormStatus should be inside a form tag that is why i create another file for yhe submit button, and fix error I have just changed below packages from:

    "react": "^18",
    "react-dom": "^18",
    "@types/react": "^18",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18",

Into:

    "react": "18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "18.2.0",
    "@types/react": "18.2.14",
    "@types/react-dom": "18.2.6",
